	The Pressidium&reg; Pinnacle Platform aggressively caches your pages, your feeds, your images even
	your redirects. This aggressive caching results in blazing fast page loads and in a serious performance
	boost for your WordPress site in general.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	Cache invalidation is performed automagically when needed, for example when you edit or update an existing 
	page or post. If for some reason, you need to flush the cache on your own (perhaps due to a change on a 
	plugin setting), then you can use the cache control widget below.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	<strong>Note:</strong> caching is totally disabled for logged-in users and while browsing the staging environment.
